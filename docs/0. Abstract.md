This winter, we decided to study the task scheduling problem with Reinforcement Learning under the guidance of Professor. Initially, we started by studying a paper that was suggested by the professor. The paper implemented a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) model to solve the scheduling optimization problem.

Based on this study, we made a custom environment of stable baseline3 so that we could try out sb3's RL algorithms on our environment.
Our study involved the following steps:

1. Constructing a scheduling environment
2. Training models to this environment with various RL algorithms
3. Comparing the algorithms and finding out which algorithm is the best
4. Experimenting with some changes such as different algorithms, hyperparameters, etc.

The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of applying RL to scheduling optimization problems and to gain experience in the field.
